For support, see the [Vipps for Shopify support system](https://vipps-shopify.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3).

**Important deprecation notice:** Shopify has changed their APIs and the previous
Vipps app is no longer supported after July 31, 2022. You will have to install a
new Vipps app to be able to support Vipps payments. Remember to capture/refund/cancel
all existing orders before installing the new app. It is also possible to manually
capture/refund/cancel in the [Vipps Portal](https://portal.vipps.no).
The new Vipps payment app is available from [https://apps.shopify.com/vipps?locale=nb](https://apps.shopify.com/vipps?locale=nb).
